## Fun Fact
The name TorquiGen is inspired by the Torquigener genus of pufferfishes native to the Indian and Pacific oceans. These fish are known for their unique ability to build circular structures on sandy sea bottom. [(source)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torquigener)

## Features
- A novel symmetry engine, mostly geared towards continuous, radial symmetry
- Support for Firefox, Chrome, and Safari.  Tested on macOS, ipadOS, Linux, and Windows
- Loop-based automation for controls, giving each control a repeating curved based on two 'tween functions
- Webm and GIF export, as well as lossless tar of pngs
- Take stills with screenshots or right click
- Support for high-res output, as well as quality-enhancing Supersampling and Bilinear Filtering
- Several fun effects like bloom, color manipulation, and spiral twisting, all of them automatable.

## Contributing
There are several ways to contribute.  Currently, preset submissions on Discord that we could include in a Preset gallery would be appreciated.  Code and bug fixes welcome as well :)

## Development
The program is all static HTML and assets.  No `npm` is needed, it is all vanilla browser JS.  Cloning it and running a server locally in your prefereed way (such as `python3 -m http.server`) should be all you need to get started.

Please feel free to fork, pull request, make issues.  Contributors are welcome, and can join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/cZYa2bDjs9)
